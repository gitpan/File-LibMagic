      "normalisation"-problem -> changed t/6-oo.t

0.88 May 2008
      more experiments

0.87 May 2008
      experimenting with magic_buffer_offset

0.86 May 2008
      'file' version 4.24 returns slightly different filetypes.
      this makes 'make test' fail. fixed it for the new 
      version. But I'm afraid this breaks the 'make test' for
      older versions of the package 'file'.
