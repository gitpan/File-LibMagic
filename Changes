1.05     2014-12-13 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Added a test that outputs the return value of magic_version() to help me
  debug test failures.


1.04     2014-12-13 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Added yet another OO API to File::LibMagic. This provides a simpler and more
  future-proof API which can be expanded on later. The new methods are
  info_from_string(), info_from_filename(), and info_from_handle(). The latter
  method allows you to get info about an open filehandle. These new methods
  return the description, MIME type, and character encoding in one call. This
  addresses RT #54843 and partially addresses RT #99470.


1.03     2014-08-30

- The shipped Makefile.PL now accepts --lib and --include command line
  arguments so you can specify additional lib and include directories. This
  should make this package easier to build on BSD systems, among
  others. Reported by Alexander Bluhm. RT #97945.


1.02     2014-07-26

- Added instructions for installing libmagic.so and magic.h to the POD and
  INSTALL.md file. Requested by Gabor Szabo. RT #97391.

- Switched from using Devel::CheckLib to Config::AutoConf with the hope that
  the latter will work with more compilers. Requested by Jens Rehsack. RT
  #46543.

- Switched the primary git repo to github
  (https://github.com/autarch/File-LibMagic).


1.01     2014-05-04

- Fixed repository metadata. Reported by Jens Rehsack. RT #89200.

- A File::LibMagic object would not close one of the handles it might have
  opened, leading to leaks. Reported by Alexander Zaitsev. RT #93512.


1.00     2013-09-02

- Don't get all excited about this being 1.00. It's just what comes after
  0.99.

- The checktype_contents() and describe_contents() methods now accept a scalar
  ref in addition to a plain scalar. RT #28747.


0.99     2013-08-26

- More test changes to try to get tests passing on midnightbsd.


0.98     2013-08-25

- Fix test failures on midnightbsd (I hope) by relaxing a MIME type check in
  one of the tests.


0.97     2013-06-23

- Updated to the latest Devel::CheckLib, which should fix error reported by
  Perl 5.18 against the old CheckLib we were shipping. Reported by Dominic. RT
  #85210.

- We no longer link against libz, since this module doesn't need it. Reported
  by Ansgar Burchardt. RT #56479.

- Fixed tests to work with the latest libmagic. Patch by Gregor Herrmann. RT
  #75457.

- Attempted to make the tests work with various versions of libmagic. Please
  report failures and your file/libmagic package versions.

      small error in t/6-oo.t

0.93     2009-05-12
      using Devel::CheckLib as suggested in 
      http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/CPANAuthorNotes

      "normalisation"-problem -> changed t/6-oo.t

0.91     2009-05-12
      Changed t/6-oo.t in order to pass 'make test' for file-5.x

      removed some debugging code I accidently left in

0.89     2008-08-06
      added -lz to Makefile.PL in order to compile under 
      FreeBSD

0.88     2008-05-18
      more experiments

0.87     2008-05-18
      experimenting with magic_buffer_offset

0.86     2008-05-18
      'file' version 4.24 returns slightly different filetypes.
      this makes 'make test' fail. fixed it for the new 
      version. But I'm afraid this breaks the 'make test' for
      older versions of the package 'file'.
