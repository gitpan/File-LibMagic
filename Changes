- Updated to the latest Devel::CheckLib, which should fix error reported by
  Perl 5.18 against the old CheckLib we were shipping. Reported by Dominic. RT
  #85210.

- We no longer link against libz, since this module doesn't it. Reported by
  Ansgar Burchardt. RT #56479.

- Fixed tests to work with the latest libmagic. Patch by Gregor Herrmann. RT
  #75457.

- Attempted to make the tests work with various versions of libmagic. Please
  report failures and your file/libmagic package versions.

      experimenting with magic_buffer_offset

      'file' version 4.24 returns slightly different filetypes.
      this makes 'make test' fail. fixed it for the new 
      version. But I'm afraid this breaks the 'make test' for
      older versions of the package 'file'.
